I am sitting there staring at the blank editor. Where to start?

I know the rules of the puzzle, I think I know the game flow I would like my players to experience, but still where to start? This could all be accomplished myriad ways, with a ton of different designs. What will be best?

Instead of diving into code, I decided to start with planning. I wrote player stories, broke those out into game stories, ended up breaking some of those out into timer stories because it was easy, quick, and natural. In doing this, I can see that the game is going to have dependencies that will need to be broken out into more detail too. By phrasing it as "This object will _ ", the simple language begins to make the object's job very clear and it becomes very clear when I'm trying to make the object do something it shouldn't, because the language sounds awkward.

This is my first pass, at a high level, before I have written any code at all in thinking about Single Responsibility. Sandi Metz says:

Reusable classes are pluggable units of well-defined behavior that have few entanglements. An application that is easy to change is like a box of building blocks; you can select just the pieces you need and assemble them in unanticipated ways. A class that has more than one responsibility is difficult to reuse."
She also says that an easy way to check this about your class is to "...pretend that it's sentient and to interrogate it. If you rephrase every one of its methods as a question, asking the question ought to make sense."

I'm trying to do that in my planning and in my specs, before I even lay a line of code down.
